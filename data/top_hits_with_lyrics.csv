Take a look inside your heart
Is there any room for me (Is there any room for me?)
I won't have to hold my breath
Till you get down on one knee (Till you get down on one knee)
Because you only want to hold me
When I'm looking good enough (When I'm looking good enough)
Did you ever feel me?
Would you ever picture us? (Would you ever picture us?)

[Verse 2: PinkPantheress]
Every time I pull my hair
Well, it's only out of fear (Only out of fear)
That you'll find me ugly
And one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying?
It was nеver even lovе (It was never even love)
Did you ever want me?
Was I ever good enough? (Ever good enough?)

[Chorus: PinkPantheress]
The-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

[Verse 1: RAYE]
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar

Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

[Pre-Chorus]
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people

This girl make me feel like less of a man 'cause I'm feelin' depressed and stuff
Can't believe I was willing to drop everyone and invest in us

Look, I thought that we could've been
Maybe, I was too optimistic
Tell me what you need, I'll provide everythin'

[主歌 1]
肩负高空飞升之使命
我深知 我将因追寻我并非渴望的生活 而赴汤蹈火
未曾听从回复 曾也从智者身上汲取教训

[预副歌]
你永远都不应该 听从未曾实践之人的建议
他们说我绝对无法开拓新机
他们说我永远无法望见光明
这便是为何 我每次都得摒除一切杂念

只要我尚存一息 就莫要说我一败涂地
与月光赛跑 我倍道而进

You can't surprise a Gemini (I wish I knew)
I'm everywhere, I'm cross-eyed, and (I wish I knew you wanted me)
Now that you're back, I can't decide (I wish I knew)
If I decide if you're invited (I wish I knew you wanted me)
You always knew the way to wow me
Fuck around, get tongue-tied, and
I turn it on, I make it rowdy
Then carry on, but I'm not hidin'
You grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found
It's biscuits, it's gravy, babe

You can't surprise a Gemini
But you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
I knew you'd come back around
'Cause you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
Let's fuck in the back of the mall, lose control
Go stupid, go crazy, babe
I know I'll be in your heart 'til the end
You'll miss me, don't beg me, babe21Embed"

Será mi tótem, lo sabes tú y nadie más
[Estribillo]
I don't need honesty
Baby, lie like you love me, lie like you love me
Cover me in a dream, I'll be yours or fantasy
Who needs the honesty?
Baby, lie like you love me, lie like you love me
Maybe at the end, it becomes real enough for me
I don't need honesty
Baby, lie like you love me, lie like you love me
Cover me in a dream, I'll be yours or fantasy
Who needs the honesty?
Baby, lie like you love me, lie like you love me
Maybe at the end, it becomes real enough for me
